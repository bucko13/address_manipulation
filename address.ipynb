    "\n",
    "Before I explain address serialization, I must first explain base58, and give some examples of converting between bases.\n",
    "\n",
    "base58 is a base of 58, as opposed to decimal (base 10), hexidecimal (base16), binary (base 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 58 characters used to represent data that is base58 encoded\n",
    "(`123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz`)\n",
    "\n",
    "> In contrast to Base64, the digits of the encoding do not line up well with byte boundaries of the original data. For this reason, the method is well-suited to encode large integers, but not designed to encode longer portions of binary data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because 58 is not a power of two, the characters in base58 don't correspond to a fixed number of bytes.\n",
    "Decimal has the same problem, one byte has 256 values, but that can require 1, 2, or 3 decimal characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this, when converting a number to base58 from any other standard base, I don't think you can know what the least significant digits will be as they are dependent on all the digits in the input. I think this is true, but couldn't find a reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most significant digits, however, are not dependendent on all the digits, only the most significant ones."
